==============

This is the source code for the document “Recommendations for Reporting MCMC
Analyses in Academic Literature,“ which suggests how Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) analyses should be reported in the refereed academic literature so that
others can understand what was done and reproduce it if needed.

The nicely-formatted document itself lives at
<http://pkgw.github.io/mcmc-reporting/>.
